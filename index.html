                <p>A motivated 23-year-old warehouse manager, former crane operator, who enjoys quite possibly every genre of music known to mankind. Whether the mood calls for it or not, humor is a necessary part of every day. In search of a good laugh through my skepticism or cynical outlook on the world usually isn't too difficult.
                    I'm addicted to delicious food as has been proven by my many failed attempts at dieting; although, the one change that I've shown an absolute change in might be one that most find impossible... Vegan! 
                    Mexican and atheist, to some, the two don't even mix. An oxymoron of religion and heritage. BUT, life has a way of teaching you that things aren't always the way you knew them to be. What began as a few semesters of biology and logic at Cal State University, Northridge grew in to a deeper learning experience then what was expected. Things began to seem binary, either it was, or it wasn't. Religion just had too much gray area for me.
                    However, growing up in a working-class family, I believe I learned whatever morals were important to become the gentleman I am today. Happily married to my "high school sweetheart", we care for two annoying, but loveable furballs. I've decided to fast-track my career in web development by enrolling in UCLA Extension's coding bootcamp in order to give them and myself a beautiful and prosperous life. 
                    Anyways, it's been lovely having you get to know me. </p>
